Text-Based Clash Royale (TCR) - System Architecture
================================================

1. Overview
-----------
TCR is a client-server based multiplayer game implemented in Go. The system uses TCP for reliable communication between clients and the server.

2. System Components
-------------------
2.1 Server Components
    - GameManager: Manages game sessions and matchmaking
    - GameSession: Handles individual game instances
    - ClientHandler: Manages client connections and communication
    - ConfigManager: Handles configuration and specifications

2.2 Client Components
    - GameClient: Main client interface
    - ConnectionManager: Handles server communication
    - GameState: Manages local game state
    - UserInterface: Handles user input and display

3. Communication Architecture
----------------------------
3.1 Protocol
    - TCP for reliable communication
    - JSON for data serialization
    - Custom PDU format for message exchange

3.2 Network Flow
    - Client connects to server
    - Authentication process
    - Matchmaking
    - Game session establishment
    - Real-time game state updates

4. Data Management
-----------------
4.1 Storage
    - JSON files for:
      * User data
      * Game specifications
      * Configuration
    - In-memory game state

4.2 Data Flow
    - Server maintains game state
    - Clients receive state updates
    - Periodic state synchronization

5. Security
-----------
5.1 Authentication
    - Username/password based
    - Password hashing
    - Session management

5.2 Data Protection
    - Input validation
    - State verification
    - Anti-cheat measures

6. Scalability
--------------
6.1 Session Management
    - Multiple concurrent games
    - Efficient resource usage
    - Cleanup of completed sessions

6.2 Performance
    - Goroutine-based concurrency
    - Efficient state updates
    - Resource optimization

7. Error Handling
----------------
7.1 Connection Issues
    - Automatic reconnection
    - State recovery
    - Error logging

7.2 Game State
    - Validation checks
    - State recovery
    - Error reporting

8. Future Considerations
-----------------------
8.1 Potential Improvements
    - UDP for real-time updates
    - WebSocket support
    - Database integration
    - Load balancing
